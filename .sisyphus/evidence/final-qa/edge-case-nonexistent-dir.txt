Date: 2026-02-17

Command: /tmp/claude-grid 2 --dir /nonexistent

  Layout: 1x2 grid (864x1117 per window)
  Directory: /nonexistent
  Spawning 2 Claude Code instances...
  Session "grid-ac72" created.
Exit Code: 0

Expected: Error or warning about nonexistent directory
Actual: No validation — proceeds with nonexistent path

Note: The tool does not validate directory existence before spawning.
Terminal windows will open in the default directory or fail to cd.
This is a minor issue — not a crash. The tool could benefit from
pre-validating the --dir path in a future version.

Session cleaned up successfully.

VERDICT: PASS (no crash, graceful handling, minor enhancement opportunity)
