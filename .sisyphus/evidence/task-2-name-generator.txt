TASK 2: Branch Name Generator - QA Evidence
=============================================

DELIVERABLES COMPLETED:
✓ File created: internal/git/names.go
✓ File created: internal/git/names_test.go
✓ Function: GenerateBranchPrefix() returns adjective-noun pairs

TEST RESULTS:
=============
Test 1: TestGenerateBranchPrefixFormat
  - Validates pattern ^[a-z]+-[a-z]+$ across 20 calls
  - Status: PASS

Test 2: TestGenerateBranchPrefixVariety
  - Generates 10 calls, expects ≥2 unique values
  - Status: PASS (variety confirmed)

Test 3: TestGenerateBranchPrefixValidWords
  - Validates all adjectives and nouns are from approved lists
  - Runs 50 iterations to ensure consistency
  - Status: PASS
