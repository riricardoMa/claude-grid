TASK 7: Makefile Creation - Verification Evidence
==================================================

DELIVERABLE: Makefile with standard Go project targets

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
=====================

1. FILE CREATED: Makefile
   Location: /Users/boxiangma/Documents/GitHub/claude-grid/Makefile
   Status: ✓ Created successfully

2. TARGETS IMPLEMENTED:
   ✓ build   - Compiles binary to bin/claude-grid with ldflags
   ✓ test    - Runs all tests with -count=1 -v
   ✓ vet     - Runs go vet ./...
   ✓ clean   - Removes bin/ directory
   ✓ install - Installs binary with ldflags
   ✓ check   - Composite target: vet test build

3. LDFLAGS CONFIGURATION:
   ✓ Version injection: -X main.version=$(VERSION)
   ✓ Commit injection: -X main.commit=$(COMMIT)
   ✓ Date injection: -X main.date=$(DATE)
   ✓ Strip symbols: -s -w

4. QA SCENARIO: make vet
   Status: ✓ PASS
   Output: No errors from go vet ./...

5. QA SCENARIO: make test
   Status: ⚠ PARTIAL (pre-existing test failure unrelated to Makefile)
   - Tests run successfully via Makefile
   - One pre-existing test failure in TestCalculateGrid/count=8
   - This is NOT a Makefile issue

6. QA SCENARIO: make build
   Status: ✓ PASS
   Binary created: bin/claude-grid
   Size: 2.4M (arm64 Mach-O executable)
   Ldflags applied: ✓
   Version output: "claude-grid version dev (commit: 57662b3, date: 2026-02-18T05:56:48Z)"

7. BINARY VERIFICATION:
   ✓ Binary executable at bin/claude-grid
   ✓ Binary runs successfully
   ✓ Version information correctly injected
   ✓ Commit hash correctly injected
   ✓ Date correctly injected

CONCLUSION:
===========
Makefile successfully created with all required targets and ldflags configuration.
All Makefile functionality verified and working correctly.
Pre-existing test failure (TestCalculateGrid/count=8) is unrelated to this task.
